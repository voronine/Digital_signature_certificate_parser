In my project, I am implementing a certificate storage system using JavaScript for the browser. The front-end consists of a web page displaying a table of currently added certificates. When a certificate is clicked, brief information about it is displayed. Added certificates are saved in LocalStorage, ensuring they are displayed even after the page is reloaded. Certificates can be added to the storage by dragging and dropping files into a designated area.

React is being used for this implementation.

Key Functionalities:

A table displaying the current certificates.
Displaying brief information when a certificate is clicked.
Saving certificates in LocalStorage to maintain their state after the page is reloaded.
Adding certificates through drag-and-drop.
Implemented Steps:

Created a new project using React.
Developed a component for displaying the certificate table.
Developed a component for displaying brief information about a certificate.
Implemented saving certificates in LocalStorage.
Added drag-and-drop functionality for adding new certificates.
Ensured loading and displaying saved certificates upon page reload.
